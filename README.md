# weather3Temp
Simple Ionic app that displays 3 temperatures:
* current
* tonight's low (until midnight), and
* tomorrow's high.

More importantly, it has code to manipulate and display weather data,
which shows how to add instance variables and methods to a service.

Caveats:
* It's useful sample code, but not perfect.  Please suggest improvements.
